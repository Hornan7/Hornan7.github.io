My name is Mike Hornan and I love all things Cardano governance.
If you would like me to vote in favor of your governance action, you would probably like to talk to me about it beforehand. 
Otherwise, I will be obliged to vote according to my values, which for testing purposes, are unfortunately not very commendable on Sancho Testnet.
That being said, I wish you a great day.
