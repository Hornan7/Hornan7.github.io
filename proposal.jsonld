    "abstract": "This proposal seeks the allocation of 400k ADA from the Catalyst Treasury to fund legal action against CarDoggo, a crypto influencer who misappropriated $10M USD from Catalyst Fund 12 under false pretenses. The legal action aims to recover misused funds and uphold the integrity of Catalyst funding.",
    "motivation": "CarDoggo misled the community by submitting falsified analytics and diverted funds intended for Cardano ecosystem growth to Solana. This betrayal not only jeopardizes the credibility of Catalyst but also undermines trust in decentralized funding mechanisms. Legal recourse is essential to demonstrate accountability and protect the interests of the Cardano community.",
    "rationale": "Pursuing legal action is necessary to attempt recovery of misused funds and deter future fraudulent proposals. With 90% of DReps already supporting the action, the allocation of 400k ADA will establish a legal fund to represent Catalyst's interests. This aligns with the pre-approved 2024 budget provision of 500k ADA for legal expenses.",
